# eventframework

A very basic chat client built as a demonstration of one way to do asynchronous messaging using Clojure, Compojure, and Aleph.  This was built in large part as an exercise for me to learn how to use these tools plus Heroku.

A standalone jar with all dependencies included can be produced with `lein uberjar`.
